|-----------|-----------|
| *" empirical economists simply make the assumption that their data is regular and deduce laws based on it."* ||
| *"Just because we are able to construct measures of unemployment, gross domestic production, consumption, investment, and other economic quantities does not mean that these factors are causally related to one another in scientifically preordained relationships based on quantifiable and testable magnitudes."* ||
| ![Figure 1. Unemployment and inflation](Figure%201.%20Unemployment%20and%20inflation.jpg) | The Phillips curve is an economic theory that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship. Decades of accumulated evidence debunk this theory, as examplified in the 1970s when inflation and unemployment simultaneously rose, and the early 2020s when inflation and unemployment simultenaously fell. |
| *"After a century of aping physics and abandoning classical methodological foundations, economics has failed to produce one quantitative law or formula that can be independently tested and replicated."* ||
| *"Attempting to alter the underlying market reality by altering its reflection is unworkable."* ||
| *"Mandating laws against humans' self-interested nature does not change human nature; it re-duces the incentive to behave legally and so destroys society's respect for laws."* ||
| *"The value of goods arises from their relationship to our needs, and is not inherent in the goods themselves. With changes in this relationship, value arises and disappears."* ||
| *"Without a standard objective unit, measurement is not possible, and valuation cannot be expressed in objective numerical cardinal terms"* ||
| *"Without a common constant unit, the only way we can express valuation is in ordinal terms"* ||
| *" the producer will make a profit. This indicates that her investment in this process was productive to society"* ||
| *" this signals to the producer that she is engaging in a destructive production process, and the longer she engages in it, the more capital resources she squanders."* ||
| *"Humans make decisions based not on the total or abstract utility of an object but on the utility offered by distinct quantities of the good and their ability to satisfy our distinct needs."* ||
| *"There are only ever subjective values of the next (marginal) unit of good X to the person making the valuation."* ||
| *"all individual economic decisions pertaining to a resource are made at the margin, based on the next marginal unit of land to be exploited, the marginal cost of extracting the next unit, and the marginal revenue expected from selling it."* ||
| *"Economic calculations are constantly being done at the margin, and they pertain only to scarce resources that involve an opportunity cost."* ||
| *"While commodity prices can and usually do rise in terms of national currencies, that is a result of the debasement of national currencies. When measured against wage rates, or the price of human time, all commodities are in long-term price decline, even as consumption steadily increases."* ||
| **Time Preference** |Time preference is the tendency to prefer present satisfaction over future utility due to the uncertainty of life. It varies among individuals, with a lower time preference indicating a greater concern for the future and a higher time preference reflecting a focus on the present.|
| *"Ultimately, the economic question is how we trade off present utility against longer survival and future utility. The most important trade an individual conducts is their trade with their future self"* ||
| *"Reason, and the desire to live long and well, conspire to lower man's time preference. They call on him not only to abandon leisure in search of the hardships of work, but also to provide for his future self through deferring current consumption, saving for the future, and accumulating durable goods and productive capital."* ||
| *"It is this process of lowering time preference, future orientation, and provision for the future that sets in motion the process of civilization. Or, as Hans-Hermann Hoppe put it, "once it is low enough to allow for any savings and capital or durable consumer-goods formation at all, a tendency toward a fall in the rate of time preference is set in motion, accompanied by a 'process of civilization."* ||
| *"There is always the possibility of conflict over contestable (scarce) re-sources. This is in the very nature of scarce, or rivalrous, resources. By assigning an owner to each resource, the legal or property rights system establishes objective, publicly visible or discernible boundaries or borders that nonowners can avoid."* ||
| *"four types: consumer goods, durable goods, capital goods, and monetary goods."* ||
| *"the existence of an objective, intersubjectively ascertainable link between the owner and the resource claimed," as Hoppe puts it."* ||
| *"Although economic theory does not dictate political ideology, understanding economic scarcity and subjectively valuing peace and civilization will incline a person to adopt a libertarian outlook. There are no alternatives to self-ownership that do not result in propagating conflict and engendering enmity and resentment between individuals and groups."* ||
| *"Understanding the concept of property makes an individual able to economize more effectively and increase the productivity and value of his time. By investing his labour in the production of durable goods, man is able to draw on their services for longer, lowering his time preference in the process and learning to prioritize the future more."* ||
| *"Producing using capital goods can be thought of as producing with the aid of the labour, nature, and time that went into making the capital good."* ||
| *"The same human being, spending the same number of hours during the same day, could catch one fish or 5 tons of fish, depending entirely on the capital he is able to deploy to the task."* | |
| *"Try to survive a winter without the capital equipment we use to build our modern homes, warm them, and protect them from storms. It is accurate to think of poverty as the lack of capital."* | |
| *"A good literary illustration of the value of capital comes from George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London."* | |
| *"Many things are made cheap by owning the capital, and capitallessness is a prime reason why poverty can appear insurmountable."* | |
| *"Nor have they ever demonstrated a grasp of the concept of opportunity cost, as is apparent from their policy proposals, which are made for a Garden of Eden that has no scarcity, and forces no choices on governments or individuals."* | |
| *"No appreciation of the difficulty and importance of capital accumulation can be obtained without understanding scarcity and opportunity cost, and that helps explain why socialist governments culminate in the wholesale destruction of society's capital."* | |
| *"Governments under the influence of these ideologies have too often attempted to finance investment without preexisting savings."* | |
| *"Whether it is through printing physical money or credit expansion, the underlying delusion is the same: Creating claims on capital can replace the need for saving to produce capital."* | |
| *"The constraint on capital accumulation is not natural or physical; it is human and lies precisely in how much of their output humans want to invest in future production versus present consumption; in other words, the constraint on capital production is time preference."* | |
| *"The root of the Luddites' confusion was their treatment of labor as if it were a consumer good, acquired for the utility it provides, rather than a producer good."* | |
| *"As more workers can be fed by the efforts of others, thus freeing them from having to engage in subsistence labor and allowing them to produce more sophisticated goods."* | |
| *"Technological advancement does not eliminate demand for labor, but there is compelling evidence that it does eliminate slavery."* | |
| *"As specialization and productivity increase along with capital accumulation, a worker's output becomes increasingly valuable, allowing him to command a more valuable reward for his labor."* | |
| *"The benefits of mutual cooperation grow as the productivity of workers increases."* | |
| *"This evolutionary process of selection and variation continues indefinitely with technologies, and there are no good reasons to expect it to stop, because it is ultimately driven by humans' need to economize—an eternal problem that cannot be evaded."* | |
| *"Humans are always economizing, and that requires the application of reason to improve the process of production."* | |
| *"Software can be thought of as the purest form of technological good—non-rival and non-scarce."* | |
| *"The high cost of drug development, usually cited as the justification for monopoly profits, comes predominantly from the cost of litigation and regulatory approval required to secure drug approval and patents."* | |
| *"There is no empirical evidence that they serve to increase innovation and productivity."* | |
| *"'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,' was how Isaac Newton."* | |
| *"Isaac Newton (who, incidentally, was responsible for placing England on the gold standard)."* | |
| *"Only when directed to the satisfaction of our needs can energy sources be considered goods, and only when directed to the satisfaction of our needs does energy indeed become scarce, and thus, an economic good."* | |
| *"Energy, then, is not an economic good, but power is."* | |
| *"Humans cannot value energy sources in the aggregate, but only at the margin; they value the next unit of energy directed to the satisfaction of their needs over a forthcoming period."* | |
| *"Applying the framework of subjective valuation at the margin to understand energy is a powerful explanatory tool that illuminates the nature of energy markets."* | |
| *"To the extent that energy provides utility to humans, it does so at the margin, in the form of power."* | |
| *"As humans value goods at the margin, humans value energy in the form of power, the quantity of energy provided per second."* | |
| *"Capital accumulation took off in a fundamentally different way after these fuels allowed humans to use rapidly growing quantities of power."* | |
| *"Slavery as an institution was more common in a world of primitive energy sources because having the energy of another human at your service meant a very substantial increase, almost a doubling, in the total amount of energy available to meet your needs."* | |
| *"In the context of energy poverty, having another human being provide you with their energy was extremely significant."* | |
| *"As energy sources invaded human life, increasing our productivity and standard of living, the marginal benefit of enslaving a human shrunk significantly."* | |
| *"But when dealing with others, the individual is confronted with another will, one with its own desires, preferences, ends, and actions."* | |
| *"There are only two modes of interaction between people: consensual and coercive."* | |
| *"Trade is often referred to as a positive-sum game: The total gain accruing to each participant in trade is necessarily positive. Otherwise, they would not have engaged in it."* | |
| *"Value is assigned by the human mind, and valuation is made at the margin."* | |
| *"Diminishing marginal utility."* | |
| *"Production possibilities frontier—a line that illustrates all the possible combinations of both goods that can be produced."* | |
| *"The motivations for trade can be derived from differences in taste and valuation, as mentioned above, but in an extended market order, they are driven ultimately by differences in the cost of production and intensified by specialization."* | |
| *"In Human Action, Mises explains that specialization is driven by differences in abilities and nature-given factors."* | |
| *"In Man, Economy, and State, Rothbard argues that specialization is driven by (a) differences in suitability and yield of the nature-given factors; (b) differences in given capital and durable consumer goods; and (c) differences in skill and in the desirability of different types of labor."* | |
| *"Without extensive accumulation of capital, there would be little scope for the increase in productivity that drives the differences in opportunity cost, which necessitate specialization."* | |
| *"Economics, as a field of study, attempts to explain the universal pervasiveness of trade."* | |
| *"The services money renders are conditioned by the height of its purchasing power."* | |
| *"Nobody wants to have in his cash holding a definite number of pieces of money or a definite weight of money; he wants to keep a cash holding of a definite amount of purchasing power."* | |
| *"As the operation of the market tends to determine the final state of money's purchasing power at a height at which the supply of and the demand for money coincide, there can never be an excess or a deficiency of money."* | |
| *"Grain, to the fisherman, is not a consumer good; it is a medium of exchange: It is a good acquired not for the sake of its own utility, but for the sake of exchanging it for the good the holder actually desires."* | |
| *"Central to Menger's analysis of salability is the measure of the spread between the bid and ask prices for assets."* | |
| *"Being the most salable good, money is the easiest good to exchange for consumer goods."* | |
| *"The lack of coincidence of wants is the problem money solves, and it manifests across several dimensions."* | |
| *"With increasingly global and long-distance trade, the movement of physical gold and silver was no longer an economical method of conducting trade. Credit based on these metals emerged as a medium of exchange in its own right, and eventually, government capture of banking institutions allowed government credit to effectively displace gold and silver in World War I."* | |
| *"Stock-to-flow ratio, wherein stock refers to the total above-ground liquid stockpiles that can be used in a monetary role, while flow refers to new annual mining output."* | |
| *"Distinguish between market demand for a good, where consumers demand the good in order to hold it or consume it for its own sake and properties, and monetary demand for a good, where consumers hold the good merely as a monetary medium."* | |
| *"The stock-to-flow metric has a value close to 1 for all metals, except gold and silver. As base metals' production is constantly being consumed in industrial applications."* | |
| *"Silver's demonetization took off in earnest in 1871, after the end of the Franco-Prussian war. Germany, which was then the largest economy still on a silver standard, asked for its indemnity from France in gold and used the indemnity to switch to a gold standard."* | |
| *"Certain goods will naturally succeed at playing the role of money better than others, and the market process will bring these to the fore and cause their adoption as money to grow."* | |
| *"Mises went further than Menger in explaining how the choice of money can emerge purely on the market through his regression theorem, which explained how a normal market good can develop into a monetary good when it acquires monetary demand, thus raising its value and increasing its salability."* | |
| *"As the good acquires increasing monetary demand, its price increases beyond its market demand price."* | |
| *"Only by fraudulently revoking their money's redemption for gold did 'fiat' money come into existence."* | |
| *"Had money been an invention of the state, and had it needed state sanction to operate, Bitcoin could not have functioned as successfully as it has."* | |
| *"With money, human labor, capital accumulation, technological innovations, and trade take place in a large extended system of impersonal exchange."* | |
| *"With all prices in one unit, the entrepreneur is able to carefully calculate the costs and revenues expected from an undertaking."* | |
| *"Any supply of money is enough for any economy, as long as it is divisible."* | |
| *"Changes in money's purchasing power generate changes in the disposition of wealth among the various members of society. From the point of view of people eager to be enriched by such changes, the supply of money may be called insufficient or excessive, and the appetite for such gains may result in policies designed to bring about cash-induced alterations in purchasing power."* | |
| *"A world of constant money supply would be one similar to that of much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, marked by the successful flowering of the Industrial Revolution with increased capital investment increasing the supply of goods and with falling prices for those goods as well as falling costs of production."* | |
| *"Such a world would indeed discourage immediate consumption, just like the Keynesians fear it would, but it would also encourage saving and investment for the future, when more consumption can happen."* | |
| *"To economists familiar with marginal analysis, a decline in the propensity to spend will cause a decline in spending at the margin, and not a complete suspension of consumption. Time preference is positive."* | |
| *"Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low-time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long run, as well as a larger capital stock. Far from bringing about destitution, the reduction of consumption is the only path to abundance."* | |
| *"A market economy is a social order in which people are able to cooperate in very large numbers on economic production, providing goods and services for one another to the benefit of all involved, voluntarily, without a coercive authority dictating and coordinating their actions."* | |
| *"In economics, the convention has it that the quantity is plotted on the x-axis, while the price is plotted on the y-axis."* | |
| *"This can appear counterintuitive to anyone coming from the natural sciences."* | |
| *"With each increased unit of the good, the marginal price that the buyer would pay declines, which implies the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded declines. Demand curves always slope downward, or are vertical, but they cannot slope upward because the quantity demanded of a good cannot increase as the price increases."* | |
| *"The cost of producing the goods is the prime determinant of the producer's ordinal value scale."* | |
| *"The law of supply states that as the price goes up, owners of an economic good become more willing and able to sell larger quantities. As a consequence, supply curves slope upward only."* | |
| *"Increased prices increase producers' incentive to produce more and allow greater investment in securing raw materials and laborers, resulting in larger quantities supplied."* | |
| *"Markets are constant processes of discovery where supply and demand conditions are always equilibrating toward the prices that help produce the most value for the actors involved."* | |
| *"Factors that could shift the demand curve include changing preferences, changes in income and wealth, or changing prices of other goods and services."* | Demand can shift right or left depending on changes in preferences, income, wealth, and the prices of other goods, with normal goods seeing increased demand as income rises and inferior goods seeing decreased demand. Supply curves shift primarily due to changes in production costs and technological innovation, which influence the quantity producers can offer at different price levels. These shifts result in changes to the market equilibrium, affecting both the price and quantity of goods sold. |
| *"The difference between consumer choice and producer choice lies in the fact that the producers are not deriving personal utility from the factors that they employ; they are purely employing them in order to maximize the monetary profit they can achieve from their business."* | |
| *"We can think of the market system as the larger framework in which all the previously discussed acts of economizing can be practiced with the greatest increase in productivity."* | |
| *"The antagonism between an animal starving to death and another that snatches the food away from it is implacable. Social cooperation under the division of labor removes such antagonisms."* | |
| *"Mises further compares the power of consumers in the market to the democratic process, showing how it is superior, because it caters to the needs of all, whereas democracy only caters to the need of the winning majority."* | |
| *"For as long as governments have existed, the urge to set prices by decree has existed and has resulted in a slew of terrible and predictable consequences."* | |
| *"Should he be unable to drop his price to meet the consumers' valuation, then the good does not get produced. In order for the business to sell any particular good, the price needs to compensate the producer for the entire cost and opportunity costs incurred to make the product available."* | |
| *"If historical experience could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization."* | |
| *"Neither treatment discusses the importance of private property for the growth of capital and the importance of a free market for allocating capital to its most productive users."* | |
| *"In all three countries, the existence of a stock market is a reliable indicator of an economy transitioning between pre-capitalist, capitalist, and socialist forms of economic organization."* | |
| *"The importance of private ownership of the means of production to the economic system derives from, and illustrates, Mises' explanation of capitalism as an entrepreneurial system as opposed to a managerial system."* | |
| *"Dividing the act of investment into three distinct roles: the capitalist, the entrepreneur, and the manager."* | |
| *"As important as the function of the manager is, it is distinct from the function of the capitalist who provides the capital and the entrepreneur who allocates it, even if these roles may overlap in the same individual in certain contexts. The entrepreneur brings economic calculation to capital markets, choosing the most productive deployment of capital stock. The manager performs economic calculation on the deployed capital goods and decides how best to utilize them in the line of production chosen by the entrepreneur."* | |
| *"Unless the person making the allocation has to make real choices involving trade-offs between different options over scarce resources, they will not be able to consider the true costs involved."* | |
| *"Mises correctly identified the Achilles heel of socialist economic systems as the inability to perform calculations to allocate capital goods without considering the private property rights associated with them. There is no rational means of ascertaining how to allocate resources without property, prices, and a market for entrepreneurs and consumers to conduct economic calculation."* | |
| *"Even if they did have a market for consumer goods, the government would maintain ownership of capital goods, as that is the definition of socialism."* | |
| *"Rational economic calculation cannot happen based purely on a market in final goods. Capitalists need to bid for capital competitively for its most productive uses to emerge."* | |
| *"With no concept of opportunity cost, demands have no limit and trade-offs do not exist."* | |
| *"Economic decisions are made only in the context of scarcity, when each decision will carry with it a real cost and benefit that the decision-maker will experience in the real world."* | |
| *"Under this economic fiction framework, all economic data is known to all participants in the market, from tastes and value scales to technologies and available resources; a state of perfect competition exists between producers; and all managers have full knowledge of all prices. There are no entrepreneurs in the Misesian sense, only managers, and capital allocation is considered given."* | |
| *"Entrepreneurship brings the benefits of specialization and division of labor to the process of capital allocation and use."* | |
| *"Capitalist entrepreneurship leads to sustained increases in real wages, as more capital and more efficient capital allocation increase the productivity of labor."* | |
| *"Entrepreneurship is not all fun and games; it involves far more uncertainty than labor."* | |
| *"Labor in a large market with a highly productive division of labor can be very rewarding and involves far less risk."* | |
| *"Beyond just the economic benefits of capitalism, the social implication of capitalism is that it encourages behaviors that are conducive to peaceful societal coexistence."* | |
| *"The scarcity of time is the starting point for all economic choices. The scarcity of time forces man to choose between alternatives at all points in his life, and it means that every decision has an opportunity cost."* | |
| *"The future can only come through successfully securing survival in the present, which makes the needs of the present always more pressing and important. The present is where all senses experience life and its pleasures and pains."* | |
| *"This old-age effect may be counteracted and suspended, however. Owing to the biological fact of procreation, an actor may extend his period of provision beyond the duration of his own life. If and insofar as this is the case, his time-preference rate can remain at its adult level until his death."* | |
| *"As the concept of property rights becomes widely accepted in a society, as discussed in Chapter 5, it leads to a widespread decline in time preference as individuals begin to increase their valuation of their increasingly secure future."* | |
| *"In the same way that money solves the problem of coincidence of wants in trade, it solves it for future provision."* | |
| *"Money is always used in one of three ways: It is exchanged for consumer goods, saved in a cash balance, or exchanged for capital goods."* | |
| *"For time-sensitive unexpected expenditures, you want to have highly salable liquid cash stashed away."* | |
| *"Unlike saving, investing necessitates relinquishing control of your capital so that it can be employed in production."* | |
| *"With a small amount of wealth, salability is prized, while risk is undesirable."* | |
| *"'Cash is trash,' as every investment manager knows. People instead hold the equivalent of their savings in government bonds or low-risk investment stocks."* | |
| *"Contrary to Keynesian propaganda, inflation does not promote investment, it misallocates it."* | |
| *"The choice to allocate between consumption, savings, and investment is faced at the margin and is shaped by time preference."* | |
| *"Rather than expecting money to appreciate and thus reliably retain value into the future, fiat returned humans of the twentieth century to far more primitive times, when retaining value into the future was far less certain, and the value of their wealth was expected to be reduced in the future."* | |
| *"The proverbial seed corn is eaten."* | |
| *"But finding the right investments is difficult, requires active management and supervision, and entails risk. The path of least resistance, the path permeating the entire culture of fiat society, is to consume all your income, living paycheck to paycheck."* | |
| *"Those most likely to beat inflation with their investment are likely the rich who can afford to invest resources in researching markets, not the poor."* | |
| *"Bitcoin is free and open-source software for operating a peer-to-peer payment network with its own native currency. The two most important features of bitcoin are that its native currency has a strictly fixed supply that is completely unresponsive to demand, making it the hardest money ever invented, and that it allows for cross-border payments without needing any political authority to supervise the transaction."* | |
| *"The factors of production are then combined to produce the outputs, which are sold on the market, ideally at a revenue that exceeds costs, rewarding the entrepreneur and the capitalists with profit."* | |
| *"The task of bankers is to act as the intermediary between the saver and the entrepreneur. They perform due diligence on a large number of potential investments and make an entrepreneurial judgment on which projects are worthy of financing with savers' savings."* | |
| *"Not all bank credit is the same. Mises makes an important distinction between two different types of banking credit: Commodity credit and circulation credit."* | |
| *"Should there be a discrepancy between the quantity of credit the bank borrows and the quantity it lends, or should there be a discrepancy between the maturity dates, then the bank is no longer engaged in lending of commodity credit, but in circulation credit."* | |
| *"Time preference determines the quantity of loanable funds, which will then go to fund the projects with the highest expected returns, whose borrowers are willing to pay the highest interest rates. The more funds are saved, the lower the interest rate, the more projects can be funded, and the lower the expected rate of return on the marginal project."* | |
| ![Figure 29. Individual time market](Figure%2029.%20Individual%20time%20market.jpg) | As the interest rate rises, the demand for borrowing declines while the demand for lending increases. |
| **Originary Interest** | Mises defines originary interest as the subjective (personal) and aggregate (societal) discounting of the future, that is, the expected return to be willing to defer receipt of a capital good for a period of time. |
| *"As time preference continues to decline, and originary interest declines along with it, for business investments, it is highly likely that the market would be predominantly based on equity. Such a world would see banking neatly divided into two categories: investment equity banking and deposit banking."* | |
| *"If the processes of the market and civilization are uninterrupted, future discounting declines to the point where market interest lending is eliminated, resulting in a system free of usury, similar to those embodied by traditional Christian and Islamic banking."* | Interest rates may trend downwards, but 'eliminated' implies high cost of safekeeping, which is unlikely in the hypothesized low time preference society. |
| *"Commodity credit, which Mises defines as credit extended by banks with perfect correspondence between the quantity and maturity of the loan from the savers to the bank and from the bank to investors, meaning interest rates reflect lender time preference."* | |
| *"Fractional reserve banking generates credit without commensurate sacrifice on the part of the lender, and it is issued as fiduciary media: Notes and bank balances that are redeemable for money but do not have an equivalent amount of money available in the bank on demand to be paid for their bearer for the entire duration of the deposit."* | |
| *"A claim on money can perform the essential function of money: monetary substitutes like fiduciary media can be used as money by people, acquired and spent as payment for goods or services, without having to be redeemed for money at the issuing bank."* | |
| *"When fiduciary media are issued, they are an addition to the existing money stock. The increase in money supply naturally affects the market value of money, with substantial consequences, which the Austrian school has worked diligently to analyze over more than a century."* | |
| *"Money substitutes could be either covered by a corresponding amount of money, in which case they were 'money certificates,' or they could lack such coverage, in which case they were fiduciary media (Umlaufsmittel)."* | |
| *"The term 'money' is broadly used to refer to money and money substitutes. Mises clarifies the distinction in a way that helps explain the Austrian analysis of the business cycle."* | |
| *"But the difference between money certificates on the one hand and Umlaufsmittel on the other was such a neglected phenomenon to the point that established scientific terminology even lacked the means for expressing this difference. Mises thus introduced the expression Umlaufsmittel."* | |
| ![Figure 31. Money Typology](Figure%2031.%20Money%20Typology.jpg) | |
| *"Fiduciary media are issued by banks without money backing them, or fiat money if decreed by government authority."* | |
| *"It is not possible for that narrow money to settle monetary transactions while the money certificates are in circulation."* | |
| *"With their redeemability suspended, money certificates become fiduciary media."* | |
| *"Governments and banks attempting to pass off unbacked claims for economic resources as equivalent to the resources or backed claims to them results in an increase in the supply of money, manifesting as an increased amount of financial capital in the hands of entrepreneurs. The increased financial capital causes entrepreneurs to engage in investments for which they do not have sufficient resources, something which only becomes apparent after they begin spending their financial capital, causing an unanticipated rise in the price of their input goods, preventing them from completing projects."* | |
| *"By choosing to forgo the immediate gratification of a vacation and offering his financial assets to entrepreneurs instead, the saver has spared resources from meeting the demand for consuming holidays and allowed them to be used in the long-term production of cars."* | |
| *"Scarcity is the fundamental starting point of economics; money and financial institutions are tools we use to economize."* | |
| *"With the cost of the land, labor, and capital goods escalating, the two entrepreneurs' plans are ruined. They had performed all their economic calculations based on the prices prevalent before the fiduciary media had entered circulation."* | |
| *"An additional infusion of fiduciary media at this point can serve to delay the day of reckoning by providing businesses with more fiduciary media that improve their profitability, on paper, before they start spending it and prices rise again. For the boom to continue, credit creation needs to proceed at an accelerating pace. But it cannot continue forever, as the currency will collapse eventually."* | |
| ![Figure 32. Economic growth through investment and deferral of consumption](Figure%2032.%20Economic%20growth%20through%20investment%20and%20deferral%20of%20consumption.jpg) | The Hayekian triangle, as described in Hayek's second lecture, is a heuristic device that gives analytical legs to a theory of business cycles first offered by Ludwig von Mises. A right triangle depicts the macroeconomy as having a value dimension and a time dimension. It represents at the highest level of abstraction the economy's production process and the consumer goods that flow from it. Under normal circumstances, a shift towards investment would flatten and lengthen the Hayekian Triangle. However, expansionary monetary policy temporarily creates an artificial boom by increasing both investment and consumption, appearing to push the economy to a higher PPF curve than allowed by present technological and resource limitations. This artificial growth is unsustainable, leading to a bust as the economy returns to a lower PPF. |
| *"In the capital market, the opportunity cost of capital is forgone consumption, and the opportunity cost of consumption is forgone capital investment."* | |
| *"The interest rate is the price that regulates this relationship."* | |
| *"A standard textbook portrays the supply curve for loanable funds as a straight vertical line whose magnitude is determined by policymakers. In the Keynesian alternative universe, central banks simply determine the money supply and interest rate, and it is assumed that the physical resources will materialize to fulfill the bank's nominal monetary fantasies."* | |
| *"But real resources cannot be manifested by monetary policy, so artificially lowering the interest rate inevitably creates a discrepancy between savings and loanable funds."* | |
| *"There is no free lunch, after all, and if consumers save less, there will have to be less capital available for investors."* | |
| *"Central bank intervention causes malinvestment."* | |
| *"This economy-wide simultaneous failure of overextended businesses is what is referred to as a recession."* | |
| *"In 1913, the U.S. Federal Reserve Act was passed, and the new central bank was given the inherently contradictory dual mandate of protecting the value of the currency while also rescuing banks from financial crises, which can only be achieved by debauching the currency."* | |
| *"A capitalist system cannot function without a free market in capital, where the price of capital emerges through the interaction of supply and demand and the decisions of capitalists are driven by accurate price signals."* | |
| *"By debasing the money to achieve these goals, they are creating malinvestments and sowing the seeds of great long-term harm."* | |
| *"There is no record of price controls succeeding in bringing prices down; instead, they only ever lead to shortages, black markets, and the emergence of highly wasteful methods of rationing the limited supply."* | |
| *"By presenting economics as an objective mathematical function, when economic value itself has a unit with which it can be measured, economists can conjure any numbers needed to justify any form of aggression against the individual property."* | |
| *"Rather than follow the Austrian school method of individual action as the basis of understanding economics, modern economists, in a bold display of cargo cult science, attempted to copy physics. Most economics, since the 1930s government takeover of academia, has largely focused on trying to apply concepts borrowed from physics to John Maynard Keynes' ideas to arrive at rationalizations of government and central bank policies."* | |
| *"Mathematical economists attempted to impose a mathematical model from physics on economic reality, and whenever they were confronted with any of the countless insurmountable obstacles to mathematizing human action, they made a simplified assumption of a flattened economic reality in order to make it more pliable for math."* | |
| *"Some of the most notable of these assumptions are 1) that all agents in a market system must possess complete knowledge; 2) that they are rationally self-interested; and 3) that there is a state of perfect competition, with an infinite number of buyers and sellers for each market. These assumptions obviously do not hold in the real world, but mainstream economists have treated the assumptions' inaccuracy as proof that markets fail rather than simply realizing that such mathematical models are useless!"* | |
| *"A multitude of product information services has emerged in all such industries to allow consumers access to the information about products: movie reviews, restaurant reviews, electronics reviews, and so on."* | |
| *"And how much more destructive would it be if the irrationality is imposed at a coercive macroscale rather than restricted to them and the people who willingly and voluntarily choose to deal with them?"* | |
| *"The irony here is that government mandates turn specific industries into monopolies, which then normalizes the idea that this industry inevitably can only function as a monopoly, making it a 'natural monopoly.'"* | I don't agree here... Economies of scale may create natural monopolies in industries where competition is geographically impossible. Established companies may align servicing and pricing, creating an oligopoly that cannot be easily overcome by startups due to limited scale or coverage - Closed/Collusion Oligopoly.<br><br> Perhaps the public sector (government monopoly) is favorable to a private natural monopoly.<br><br> Perhaps anti-trust laws may aid in breaking up oligopolies. |
| *"Negative externalities can take the form of pollution or economic losses. Positive externalities can take the form of benefiting economically from activities others undertake, such as a hotel or restaurant enjoying outsized revenues thanks to a sports event taking place near their location."* | |
| *"An example of the former is pollution. If a factory starts to release waste into neighboring properties, it is simply violating the property of its neighbors. The polluting act is the initiation of aggression, and the landowner who is its victim can resort to taking a legal action against the factory."* | |
| *"By the 1980s, it became clear to Soviet leadership that continuing to operate such an enormous arsenal with a dysfunctional economic system was completely unworkable."* | |
| *"They do not choose to live in isolation from civilized society, produce their own weapons, and use them to aggress against civilization. They choose to acquire the most advanced products of the division of labor to increase the productivity of their violence. They may not have the mental capacity to understand how peaceful division of labor is so valuable to them, but their actions do."* | |
| *"The monopolist providers, on the other hand, usually benefit from their privileged economic position of being able to extract payment from the sellers irrespective of quality of service."* | |
| *"Given the aggressive nature of state prosecution of crimes against the state compared to state prosecution of state crimes against common citizens, it is not an exaggeration to say the purpose of state security is to protect the state, not the people."* | |
| *"They face no market test for performing their jobs effectively and have no profit motive to do so. They derive a great deal of profit motive from abusing their position."* | |
| *"Humans are obviously not angels, so it is no surprise that many abuse their positions."* | |
| *"In a society in which violence is legitimized for one class of citizens, their motive and financial well-being are largely irrelevant to their customer satisfaction and are strongly enhanced by abusing their privilege."* | |
| *"With funding secured irrespective of security, a powerful military-industrial complex has succeeded in channeling large quantities of money to itself by ensuring an endless parade of military conflicts for the U.S. to engage in, under the flimsiest of pretexts, making the U.S. less secure by fostering the enmity of billions worldwide."* | |
| *"With an open market in security provision, and a vested financial interest in the survival of its clients, insurance companies in a free society could take on many of the functions of the security monopolies of the state while also introducing market calculation and discipline to them."* | |
| *"To the extent that a person has any concern for the long-term sustainability and productivity of the market order on which he relies, they must favor living in a world where as many people as possible exercise full property rights in their time and property, able to cooperate at their desired terms."* | |
| *"It might be that people will willingly choose to enter into associations that perform the functions of today's government, and these organizations may have exclusive rights to aggress against members who agree to these terms. The extent to which the state is compatible with a free society is the extent to which it respects the right of secession, as discussed by Mises above."* | |
| *"As economic activity becomes increasingly digitized, and workers become mobile, this form of competition between jurisdictions is already becoming more commonplace."* | |
| *"An increasingly high number of people currently move to live in monarchies like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, offering very few political rights, along with very low taxation."* | |
| *"The fundamental facts that brought about cooperation, society, and civilization and transformed the animal man into a human being are the facts that work performed under the division of labor is more productive than isolated work and that man's reason is capable of recognizing this truth. But for these facts, men would have forever remained deadly foes of one another, irreconcilable rivals in their endeavors to secure a portion of the scarce supply of means of sustenance provided by nature. Each man would have been forced to view all other men as his enemies; scraving for the satisfaction of his own appetites would have brought him into an implacable conflict with all his neighbors. No sympathy could possibly develop under such a state of affairs."* — Ludwig von Mises | |
| *"Civilization as a process is what happens when successive generations live better lives than their predecessors. Decivilization is what happens when successive generations have worse lives than their ancestors."* | |
| *"A corollary to Hoppe's argumentation ethics is that any objection to property rights and the division of labor can only be considered if expressed without resorting to any of the fruits of the division of labor and property rights."* | |
| *"Fiat money further undermines the capitalist economic system by distorting its essential driving process: economic calculation. As the value of money stops being determined on the market through supply and demand, economic calculation for entrepreneurs becomes an error-strewn process. As can be seen today, capital markets become little more than a reaction to monetary commissars' edicts. When the bureau setting U.S. interest rates decides to lower interest rates, all assets rise in value—only to fall when interest rates rise."* | |
| *"Money is the lifeblood of an economic system, the sine qua non of economic calculation and coordination. By taking it from the realm of consensual interaction and placing it in the hands of a violent monopoly, the entire edifice of civilization is undermined and shaken. It is easy to become despondent about the fate of human civilization, but it is too soon to lose hope in the ingenuity of humans, their technologies, or a capitalist creative process that has survived millennia and defeated many enemies."* | |
| *"Capitalism has proven adept at fighting external enemies—but how can it fare against an internal parasite that controls the heart whose beat regulates its lifeblood? To survive, capitalism needs to invent and deploy an entirely independent and alternative heart to the one infested by parasites."* | |
| *"If it can unleash human civilization from the clasp of the state's fiat claws, bitcoin will be remembered as our age's most significant civilizational achievement."* | |
