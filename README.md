# EC1002 - Introduction to Economics

This repository has been created to compile work undertaken during the study of '2023-0708 EC1002' at the London School of Economics. It is intended to serve as a comprehensive collection of notes, essays, and reflections, documenting the process of engaging with and understanding the fundamental principles of economics.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository extends beyond merely cataloging coursework. It aims to reflect a broader exploration of economic thought, influenced by a passion for financial markets and an interest in Bitcoin. Supplementary readings, particularly *Principles of Economics* by Saifedean Ammous, have provided alternative perspectives on monetary theory and economic calculation, encouraging a critical examination of conventional economic models.

## Background

The pursuit of a deeper understanding of personal finance initially sparked an interest in economics, leading to the organization of savings and investment accounts and the monitoring of financial markets. This practical experience fostered an appreciation for the role of economics in shaping financial systems. Influential works, such as those by Saifedean Ammous, have offered valuable insights into the epistemological functions of markets and the importance of sound monetary theory. This repository will document the progress made in EC1002, contributing to a growing body of knowledge in the field of economics.

## Goals

1. **Academic Performance:** To master the material presented in EC1002 and achieve a high level of academic performance.
2. **Reference Development:** To create a lasting reference that can be utilized in future studies and professional activities.
3. **Engagement with Economic Theory:** To critically engage with the theories and ideas presented in the course, integrating them with insights from supplementary readings.
