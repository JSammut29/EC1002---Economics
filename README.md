# Economics Studies at LSE: EC1002 & EC2020

This repository documents the progress made in **2023-0708 EC1002 - Introduction to Economics** and **2024-0508 EC2020 - Elements of Econometrics** at the London School of Economics. It serves as a comprehensive resource for notes, essays, and critical analyses developed during these courses.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to catalog coursework and reflect a broader exploration of economic thought, driven by a passion for financial markets and an interest in Bitcoin. Supplementary readings, particularly *Principles of Economics* by Saifedean Ammous, have provided alternative perspectives on monetary theory and economic calculation, encouraging a critical examination of conventional economic models.

## Background

An initial pursuit of a deeper understanding of personal finance sparked an interest in economics, leading to the organization of savings and investment accounts and the monitoring of financial markets. Insights gained from these experiences, alongside influential economic literature, such as *The Bitcoin Standard*, have offered valuable insights into the epistemological functions of markets and the importance of sound monetary theory, and shaped the understanding and approach taken in these courses.

## Goals

1. **Academic Performance:** Achieve a strong grasp of the material presented in the courses.
2. **Reference Development:** Create a lasting reference that can be utilized in future studies and professional activities.
3. **Critical Engagement:** Engage critically with the theories and methods learned, integrating them with perspectives from supplementary readings and practical experiences.
