$\textbf{The Solow Growth Model}$, developed by economist Robert Solow, is a foundational framework in the study of economic growth. In this model, factors such as population growth, savings rates, and technological progress are considered exogenous because they are assumed to change independently of the economic output or capital accumulation within the model.

1. **Production Function**: At the core of the Solow model is the neoclassical aggregate production function, which typically takes the form; 

   $$Y = f(K, L)$$ 
   - $Y$ is total output, 
   - $K$ is the capital stock, 
   - $L$ is labor. 

   This function assumes constant returns to scale, meaning that doubling the inputs of capital and labor will double the output.

2. **Capital Accumulation**: The model emphasizes the role of capital accumulation in economic growth. The capital stock evolves over time according to the equation; 

    $$ K' = K(1 - d) + I $$
    - $K'$ is the future capital stock, 
    - $d$ is the depreciation rate, 
    - $I$ is the investment.
    
    Investment refers to the allocation of resources to create new capital goods. All savings are assumed to be invested back into the economy, leading to the relationship: $$ I = sY $$ which is the fraction of the total output saved 
    - $s$ being the savings rate.

3. **Steady State**: The Solow model predicts that economies will converge to a steady state where capital per worker and output per worker stabilize. In this state, growth in output per capita can occur only through technological progress, as capital accumulation alone cannot sustain long-term growth due to diminishing returns to capital.

4. **Exogenous Factors**: The model treats technological progress and population growth as exogenous variables. This means that these factors are not explained by the model itself but are assumed to occur at constant rates, influencing the overall growth trajectory of the economy.

5. **Conditional Convergence**: The Solow model suggests that countries with similar savings rates, population growth rates, and depreciation rates will converge to similar levels of income per capita over time, a concept known as conditional convergence. However, it does not predict absolute convergence; countries with different savings rates may settle into different steady states.

**Secular Growth** refers to a continuous rise in the economy's productive capacity over time, characterized by ongoing gross investment that is sufficient for both maintaining existing capital and accumulating new capital.

Using Solow's Growth Model, we may demonstrate that if savings merely cover capital depreciation, growth stagnates, but **increased savings can lead to greater future consumption.**

$$
sY = I > dK \rightarrow K' > K \rightarrow f(K',L) > f(K,L)
\\
Y' > Y
$$

$\textbf{Garrison's Model of Secular Growth}$ posits that secular growth has historically been associated with increasing wealth and decreasing time preferences among individuals. However, his treatment of secular growth abstracts from this relationship, focusing instead on the mechanics of capital accumulation and resource allocation.

>*Secular growth occurs without having been provoked by policy or by technological advance or by a change in intertemporal preferences. Rather, the ongoing gross investment is sufficient for both capital maintenance and capital accumulation.* <br> (Garrison, 2001, p. 54)

Garrison's model presents the idea that technological innovations require prior savings and investment to be realized. In his framework, Garrison emphasizes the importance of capital accumulation and the role of savings in facilitating technological advancement. Key growth factors such as technological progress and population growth are not treated as exogenous, since they rely on the availability of investable resources that are generated through prior savings.

Thus, a sustained increase in growth can occur when there is a permanent reduction in time preferences, leading to higher savings rates. This accumulation of capital enables firms to invest in new technologies, which can then enhance productivity and output. He posits that without sufficient savings and investment, the potential benefits of technological advancements cannot be fully realized, aligning with the Austrian perspective that emphasizes the necessity of capital for growth.

**Garrison's illustrations show outward shifts in the production possibilities frontier (PPF)** over time, representing an increase in the economy's output capacity without necessitating changes in intertemporal preferences or external technological advancements.

The model assumes **interest-rate neutrality**, meaning that the equilibrium interest rate remains constant even as the economy grows. The supply and demand for loanable funds increase concurrently. As incomes rise, savers supply more funds, while businesses demand more funds to support a growing capital structure. 

This dynamic leads to a stable equilibrium interest rate, which facilitates the allocation of resources across various production stages without altering the intertemporal profile of capital.
