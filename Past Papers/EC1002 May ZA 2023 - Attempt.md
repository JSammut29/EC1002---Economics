## Section A

### Question 1

Dunder Mifflin and the Michael Scott Paper company are two firms that sell paper. The firms compete in prices and have the same marginal costs and no fixed cost is incurred in production. We should expect both firms to make a positive profit in equilibrium.

> Since firms compete in prices, this is an example of **Bertrand Competition**. Both firms will produce paper until the price meets their marginal cost.

> It is typically assumed that margical cost curves are flat, which means at equilibrium, the firms would be making zero profits. 
$\rightarrow$ **False**

> *However, if firms have an upward-sloping marginal cost curve, they can earn margin on inframarginal sales, resulting in non-negative profits.*

### Question 2

Starland and Moonland are two countries deciding whether to invest in reducing emissions. Their payoffs are as follows:

| Starland/Moonland | Invest | Don’t |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| **Invest**        | 3, 4   | 5, 3  |
| **Don’t**         | 2, 3   | 7, 6  |

Given these payoffs there is a unique dominant strategy equilibrium.

> - **Starland's Payoffs:**
>   - If Moonland **Invests**: Starland gets 3 if they Invest, 2 if they Don't Invest.
>   - If Moonland **Doesn't Invest**: Starland gets 5 if they Invest, 7 if they Don't Invest.

> - **Moonland's Payoffs:**
>   - If Starland **Invests**: Moonland gets 4 if they Invest, 3 if they Don't Invest.
>   - If Starland **Doesn't Invest**: Moonland gets 3 if they Invest, 6 if they Don't Invest.

> **False** - There is no unique dominant strategy equilibrium in this game because neither player has a strategy that is always their best choice, regardless of what the other player does.

> *A unique dominant strategy equilibrium exists when both parties have dominant strategies.*

### Question 3

With perfect information, perfectly competitive markets lead to the efficient output of private goods.

> Private Goods are by definition excludable and rival. In perfectly competitive markets, sufficiently many firms produce and sell these goods at; $$\text{Average Total Cost}_{min} = \text{Price}$$ 
Economically, this is considered allocatively efficient because resources are allocated in a way that maximizes total welfare.

> Debate arises around unaccounted positive / negative social extarnalities, whereby; activities with positive externalities are underproduced, and negative externalities are overproduced.

> The **Coase Theorem** posits that in the presence of well-defined property rights and low transaction costs, parties will negotiate to allocate resources efficiently, regardless of the initial allocation of those rights. This theorem challenges the traditional view that externalities necessitate government intervention to correct market failures, suggesting instead that private negotiations can lead to optimal outcomes.

> For example in a true free market, pollution would be treated as a violation of property rights. If a firm pollutes a river, the affected parties (e.g., downstream users) could sue the firm, and the firm would either have to compensate them or take steps to prevent the pollution.

> **True / Uncertain** depending on transaction costs.


### Question 4

Citizens of Taxland can decide how many hours to work. This year, the government of Taxland introduced a higher income tax. The introduction of the tax lowers the real wage of Taxland’s citizens, but it is uncertain whether each citizen will work more or fewer hours following the higher tax.

> **True** - The overall change depends on the strength of the substitution and income effects.

> The higher income tax creates a **Substitution Effect** which makes leisure relatively less expensive and pushes citizens to work less and spend more time in leisure.

> However, the **Income Effect** makes them want to work more as they are now relatively poorer. 

### Question 5

There is no unemployment at full employment.

> **False** - Even at full employment, labour participation may be at less than 100%, resulting in *voluntary unemployment*.

### Question 6

The following data shows the transactions of Surplusland (in $billions) in 2020. The information provided is complete.

- Export of Goods: 30
- Imports of Goods: 20
- Change in foreign assets in Surplusland: 24
- Change in assets abroad: 16
- Export of services: 14
- Imports of services: 10
- Income receipts on investment: 10
- Income payments on investments: 20
- Unilateral transfers: 12

Surplusland’s balance of payment is equal to zero and hence the exchange rate must be flexible.

> Balance of Payments Breakdown (in $billions)

1. **Trade Balance (Goods and Services):**
   - **Exports of Goods and Services:** $30 + 14 = 44$
   - **Imports of Goods and Services:** $20 + 10 = 30$
   $$44 - 30 = \bold{14}$$

2. **Current Account (CA):**
   - **Trade Balance:** $14$
   - **Net Income (Income receipts - Income payments):** $10 - 20 = -10$
   - **Unilateral Transfers:** $-12$ *(Assumed Outward Transfers)*
   $$14 + (-10) - 12 = \bold{-8}$$

3. **Capital and Financial Account (KA/FA):**
   - **Change in Foreign Assets in Surplusland:** $+24$
   - **Change in Assets Abroad:** $-16$
   $$24 - 16 = \bold{8}$$

4. **Balance of Payments (BOP):**
   $$\text{Current Account } + \text{ Capital Account } = -8 + 8 = \bold{0}$$

> **True** - Surplusland’s BOP is zero, consistent with a **Flexible Exchange Rate Regime**, where market forces adjust the exchange rate to balance international payments.

> If Surplusland were to operate under a **Fixed Exchange Rate Regine**, you would expect to see changes in reserves to offset any BOP imbalances. However, the problem doesn’t mention reserves, which suggests that reserves aren’t playing a role in balancing the payments. This further supports the conclusion that Surplusland has a flexible exchange rate.

> In the event that Surplusland had a fixed exchange rate, we would still expect **Changes in Reserves** to be listed (as zero) in the table able. Reserves are distinct to assets, which are held by private investors.


### Question 7

In the Solow growth model if we are below the steady state equilibrium then the output must be rising because funds available to create capital are greater than the amount that is required to keep capital labor ratio constant.

> **True** - In the Solow Growth Model, given a constant savings rate, capital per worker will increase, causing the output per worker to increase, until savings equal the depreciation of existing capital at the steady state equilibrium. 

![Solow's Steady State Model](<Figures\Solow's Steady State Model.jpg>)

### Question 8

The asset motive for holding money shows its use as a low-risk store of value.

> **True** - Money serves as a safeguard against economic and situational uncertainty, providing liquidity and allowing for the strategic holding of money as a form of wealth preservation. Ludwig von Mises stated *"Money is not useful in itself but because it has a prior exchange value"*, highlighting its role in maintaining purchasing power amidst economic fluctuations .

## Section B

### Question 1

Bowen is the founder of a fashion company. His company produces dresses according to the production function $Q = 2K + L$ where $K$ captures the sewing machines used in production and $L$ the number of hours it takes a worker to sew a garment.

a) What is an isoquant? Draw a few isoquants that correspond to the production function for dresses. [5 marks]

b) Bowen wishes to produce 100 dresses. The cost of a sewing machine is £100, while a worker is paid £20 per hour. What is the optimal combination of sewing machines and hours of work that Bowen should hire? Show the optimal bundle on your diagram. What is the cost associated with producing the dresses? [10 marks]

c) Continue to assume that sewing machines cost £100 and a worker demands a wage of £20. Bowen’s firm operates in a competitive market, where many other entrepreneurs can produce similar dresses with the same cost structure. What is the expected market price of dresses? [5 marks]

d) Bowen runs a successful marketing campaign that makes consumers perceive his dresses as unique. Bowen is now free to act as a monopolist. Show graphically how Bowen will decide the price to set and quantity to produce under his new market structure. [10 marks]

> An **Isoquant** in microeconomics represents a curve that illustrates all the combinations of two inputs, typically capital and labor, yielding the same level of output. 
<br> <br>
Isoquants slope downward, reflecting the principle of the **marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)**, which quantifies how much of one input can be substituted for another without altering output levels. 

![Isoquants](<Figures\EC1002_05A23_SbQ2_Isoquants.png>)
<br>

> Isoquants help firms determine the most efficient combination of inputs for production. By analyzing isoquants alongside **isocost lines**; which represent combinations of inputs that cost the same amount, firms can identify the optimal input mix that minimizes costs while maximizing output.
<br> <br>
The high cost of sowing machines is prohibitive relative to labour costs. As such, the optimal point is at $(0,100)$, for which no sowing machines and 100 labour hours are used to manufacture 100 dresses at a total cost of; $$£20 \times 100 \text{ hours} = £2000$$

![Isocosts](<Figures\EC1002_05A23_SbQ2_Isocosts.png>)
<br>

> We expect the price to equal the marginal cost price of; $$£2000 \div 100 \text{ dresses} = £20 \text{ each}$$
<br>

> As a monopolist, Bowen will seek to maximise profits. 
<br>
Since the optimal marginal cost (*average cost*) is £20, we may consider the horizontal supply curve; $$MC = £20$$ and a downward sloping demand curve; $$P = P(Q) \text{\tiny{ (not specified)}}$$ resulting in marginal revenue curve; $$\begin{align} \text{Marginal Revenue} &= \frac{d}{dQ} \left( \text{ Total Revenue} = P(Q) \cdot Q \right) \\ &= P(Q) + Q \cdot P'(Q) \end{align} $$

![Monopoly](<Figures\EC1002_05A23_SbQ2_Monopoly.png>)
<br>

> The figure above refers. The monopolist will seek to maximise the size of the green shaded region (supernormal profit) by producing dresses only whilst the Marginal Cost is less than the Marginal Revenue, beyond which point further units will reduce profits. Thus, we may obtain the quantity produced $Q^*$ by considering the intersection $MC = MR$, and the price using $P(Q^*)$.

### Question 2

a) In the IS-MP model we have real interest rate on the vertical axis and output on the horizontal axis. Explain the IS curve, and its slope by assuming a closed economy where $C = C_0 + c(Y - T), I = I_0 - br$, and $G = G_0$. $I_0$, $G_0$, and $C_0$ are all positive, $b > 0$, and $0 < c < 1$. $T$ is a lump sum tax. [8 marks]

b) Assume that the lump sum tax is replaced by a proportional tax equal to $t$, where $t < 1$. What happens to the multiplier and the slope of the IS curve? [7 marks]

c) Assume the MP curve is given by $r = 1.0 + 0.75\pi$, where $\pi$ is the inflation rate. The IS curve is given by $Y = 12 - r$. Derive the equation of the aggregate demand curve and indicate what its intercept and slopes are. If inflation is 10%, what is the level of output? [10 marks]

d) Assume business confidence rises so $I_0$ rises by 2. What is the impact on the level of output if inflation rate is 5%? [5 marks]
