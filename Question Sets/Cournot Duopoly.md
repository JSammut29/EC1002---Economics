# Cournot Duopoly: Question Set

## Question 1

- **a)** People generally believe that oligopolies (and in particular duopolies) are always inefficient. Are they correct?

- **b)** Two firms A and B produce the same good. Each sets the price of the good. If the two firms set the same price, they share the market equally. The demand for the output of the industry is \(Q = 90 - p\) where \(p\) is the price. Both firms have a marginal and average cost of £10. The two firms observe that they can both increase profits if they set up a cartel which produces the level of industry output that maximizes industry profits.

    1. What is the output of the cartel?
    2. What is the industry price?
    3. Assume that the two firms share the market equally. What profit does each firm make?

- **c)** Suppose firm B believes that firm A will remain at its cartel level of output. What is the profit-maximizing level of output for firm B?

- **d)** Under what conditions is it difficult for firms to sustain a cartel?

---

- **Oligopoly**: A market structure characterized by a small number of firms, whose decisions are interdependent due to their significant market power, leading to strategic interactions in pricing and output decisions.

- **Cartel**: **A formal agreement between firms within an oligopoly to restrict output, raise prices, and maximize collective profits** by behaving like a monopoly.

- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The **additional cost incurred from producing one more unit of a good**. It is crucial in determining the optimal level of production.
  
- **Marginal Revenue (MR)**: **The additional revenue generated from selling one more unit of a good**. In profit-maximizing firms, MR is set equal to MC.
  
- **Allocative Efficiency**: **Occurs when resources are distributed in a way that maximizes consumer satisfaction**, where the price of goods equals the marginal cost of production (P = MC).
  
- **Productive Efficiency**: Achieved when a firm produces goods at the lowest possible cost, **meaning all resources are used optimally** and no wastage occurs.
  
- **Deadweight Loss**: **A loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium outcome is not achieved**, typically due to market distortions like taxes, subsidies, or monopolistic practices.
  
- **Dynamic Efficiency**: **Refers to the long-term improvement of products and processes**, often driven by innovation and investment in research and development, resulting in growth over time.
  
- **Economies of Scale**: **Cost advantages that firms experience as their production increases**, leading to a decrease in average costs per unit due to spreading fixed costs over a larger output.
      
- **Residual Demand**: **The remaining market demand that a single firm faces after accounting for the supply of competing firms**.

Oligopolies typically form in industries where significant barriers to entry, such as high initial capital costs, economies of scale, or regulatory constraints, limit the number of firms that can successfully compete. Established companies in these industries may align their services and pricing strategies, creating a market structure that new entrants find difficult to penetrate—resulting in what is known as a "closed" or "collusion" oligopoly.

The smaller the number of established firms, the more likely and oligopoly is to form, and the greater the potential scope of the cartel. A duopoly is the more dangerous variant of an oligopoly. Oligopolies are regarded as inefficient market structures, as they are incentivised in pursuit of greater profit to produce less goods at a higher price and inferior quality, leading to a loss in consumer surplus, allocative inefficiency and a deadweight loss. This behavior is sustainable only if firms trust that others will neither undercut prices nor significantly differentiate their products. 

However, this view is not universally correct, as the efficiency of oligopolies depends on various factors, including the potential for dynamic efficiency and the presence of economies of scale. Firms in an oligopoly may have higher profits, which can be reinvested into research and development, leading to innovation and long-term benefits for consumers. Additionally, in industries with high fixed costs, a small number of large firms can achieve economies of scale, reducing average costs and potentially leading to lower prices than would be possible with many small firms. 

The theoretical framework of oligopolies often includes the possibility of collusion, where firms agree to act as a cartel to maximize joint profits. In a duopoly where two firms produce the same good, if both firms agree to set the same price and share the market equally, they can mimic the behaviour of a monopolist. Let the demand for a good be represented by the equation $Q = 90 - p$, where $p$ is the price, and both firms have a marginal and average cost of £10. To maximize industry profits, the firms would set marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. The resulting industry output would be 40 units, sold at a price of £50 per unit. The total industry profit would be £1600, with each firm earning £800 if they share the market equally.

**Marginal & Average Cost:** £10

**Unit Profit** $\= p - 10$

**Units Sold:** $Q = 90 - p$

**Total Profit:**

$$
\text{Total Profit} = Q \times (p - 10) = (90 - p) \times (p - 10) = 100p - p^2 - 900
$$

**Maximize Total Profit:**

$$
\frac{d(100p - p^2 - 900)}{dp} = 100 - 2p = 0 \implies p = 50 \quad \text{and} \quad Q = 40
$$

**Profit Calculation:**

$$
\text{Unit Profit} = 50 - 10 = £40
$$

$$
\text{Total Profit} = 40 \times 40 = £1600
$$

The stability of the cartel can be undermined if legal institutions undergo changes, such as shifts in government, new laws, or the enforcement of antitrust regulations that disallow their practices. Deregulation may also invite new entrants, including foreign firms, which could erode the cartel's market share. Additionally, informal institutions, such as consumer advocacy groups, might organize protests or boycotts, challenging the cartel’s control. To mitigate these risks, the cartel should maintain competitive pricing and reinvest in research and development to ensure long-term stability. 

The stability of the cartel can also be undermined if one firm cheats, triggering a breakdown of the agreement. If firm B believes that firm A will adhere to the cartel agreement, firm B has an incentive to deviate by increasing its output and lowering the price slightly to capture a larger market share. This behavior, known as cheating, can lead to higher profits for the deviating firm, at least in the short term. 

Given the homogeneous nature of the products, a slight price undercut by firm B will allow it to capture the entire market share, effectively doubling its output and profits. This can be demonstrated in the below chart.

However, firm A might retaliate, kick starting a price war until the price is equal to the marginal cost, maximising productive and allocative efficiency but destroying profitability for both companies.

## Question 2

What are the particular characteristics of monopolistic competition as a market structure?

---

Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by a large number of firms that produce differentiated products, meaning each firm offers a slightly unique version of a product that is not a perfect substitute for others. This differentiation can be based on factors such as branding, quality, features, or customer service. Firms in monopolistic competition have some degree of market power, allowing them to set prices above marginal cost, but this power is limited due to the presence of close substitutes. Entry and exit barriers are low, leading to a dynamic market where firms can enter or leave with relative ease. In the long run, economic profits tend to be zero as new entrants erode any short-term profits by increasing competition. This market structure results in a balance between the monopoly power of individual firms and the competitive pressure from other firms.
