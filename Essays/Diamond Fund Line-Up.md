## Rethinking Fund Line-Ups: A Case for Innovation

Traditional fund line-ups in many asset management houses follow a familiar, **linear structure**: an Equity Fund, a Balanced Fund, and an Income Fund. While this set-up serves its purpose for a broad range of investors, it often leaves little room for product differentiation or innovation. The highly diversified nature of these funds, especially in Equity portfolios, often leads to over-diversification, causing underperformance when compared to more focused indices like the NASDAQ or S&P 500. This conventional approach caters primarily to conservative or risk-averse investors, missing an opportunity to attract younger and more aggressive market participants.

#### The Need for a Dynamic Fund Line-Up

To appeal to a broader demographic and adapt to changing market preferences, fund houses could benefit from adopting a more dynamic and differentiated line-up. Rather than sticking to a linear spectrum of low-to-high risk, a more innovative, "diamond" structure could be introduced. In this model, investors would have access to more specialized funds, allowing them to tailor their portfolios more precisely based on risk tolerance, market outlook, and personal goals. 

This proposed line-up might look something like this:

**Monetary Commodities Fund**  
Seeking to profit from changes in monetary media, this fund could allocate capital into:
- Sovereign Debt in major hard currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP),
- Gold, which historically performs well in risk-off environments as global liquidity contracts and consolidates,
- Bitcoin, which tends to benefit from increasing global liquidity and an expanding money supply.

This approach would provide a hedge against various economic scenarios, including recessions, quantitative easing or tightening, and periods of global uncertainty. Such a fund would offer protection against both short-term and long-term risks, like currency debasement, unsustainable sovereign debt, and shifting global economic powers. Given its focus on assets with no counterparty risk, this would be an aggressive fund that appeals to investors seeking safety but not willing to settle for low returns.

**Concentrated Equity Fund**  
On the other end of the spectrum, a concentrated equity fund could focus on fewer, high-conviction positions in growth industries or emerging technologies. This fund would seek to maximize returns through larger equity stakes and a more aggressive options strategy. By targeting companies poised for future dominance, this fund would cater to investors looking for higher risk and return potential, with the understanding that such concentrated positions introduce significant counterparty risk.

#### Bridging the Gap with Innovation

A fund line-up like this would provide a clear distinction between over-diversified, low-volatility strategies and higher-risk, high-return opportunities. The consolidation of existing products into fewer better-differentiated funds, and the addition of a Monetary Commodities Fund and a Concentrated Equities Fund along a new axis, could unlock new sales opportunities, making it easier to position clients into suitable products that more accurately reflect their preferences.

                      Monetary Commodities
                          /        \
            Global Equity              High Income
                          \        /
                    Concentrated Equities


This innovation would require new competencies within asset management teams. Research into emerging markets, the ability to manage higher-risk funds, and stronger relationships with brokers and dealers would become essential. By evolving beyond traditional asset classes and into areas like digital assets and commodities, asset managers could significantly expand their product offerings, meeting the needs of a more diverse range of investors.

#### Conclusion

In an environment where investors increasingly seek both security and growth, relying on a linear fund line-up of Equity, Balanced, and Income funds is no longer sufficient. Asset management firms must innovate to remain competitive, building new products that meet the changing landscape of investor demands. By offering more dynamic, specialized options, asset managers can capture a broader market while staying ahead of the curve in an industry that often plays it safe.
