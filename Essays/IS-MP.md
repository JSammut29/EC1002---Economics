## IS-MP Model

The **IS-MP model** is a useful framework for analyzing the effects of monetary policy (through the MP curve) and changes in aggregate expenditure (through shifts in the IS curve) on the economy. It helps policymakers understand how interest rates and output adjust to maintain equilibrium in both the goods and money markets. By understanding the factors that shift the AE curve and influence the IS curve, we can better grasp the dynamics of economic policy and its impact on the overall economy.

    - Saving (S)
    - Monetary Policy (MP)

### 1) **Aggregate Expenditure (AE)**
<br>

>  $\textbf{Aggregate Expenditure}$ is the total amount of spending in an economy at a given level of output (or GDP). It includes the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The general form is:
<br> $$ AE = C + I + G + (X - M) $$
    - **C**: Consumption <br>
    - **I**: Investment <br>
    - **G**: Government Spending <br>
    - **(X - M)**: Net exports (exports less imports) <br>



*In a closed economy (no international trade), net exports $(X - M)$ are ignored, simplifying AE to just consumption, investment, and government spending.*

$\textbf{Autonomous Spending}$ refers to the portion of aggregate expenditure that is independent of current income or output. Autonomous spending occurs regardless of the GDP level and includes:
- Basic consumption needs (even if households have zero income).
- Government spending that is determined by policy decisions.
- Investment driven by technological advances or business confidence rather than by current interest rates.

### 2) **Components of AE**
<br>

- **Interest Rates (I)**: Interest rates play a crucial role in determining investment. Lower interest rates typically stimulate more investment, leading to an increase in AE.
  
- **Saving (S)**: Savings reduce the immediate flow of aggregate expenditure as a portion of income is not being spent on goods and services. However, savings can finance future investments.

- **Monetary Policy (MP)**: The central bank uses monetary policy to influence interest rates, which in turn affect consumption and investment. In the IS-MP model, monetary policy plays a key role in determining the equilibrium level of output by controlling the real interest rate.

- **Output (Y)**: Output, or real GDP, represents the economy's total production. In the context of AE, it is crucial because changes in output lead to changes in income, consumption, and investment.

### 3) **IS-MP Model**

$\textbf{The 45-Degree Line}$ plays a vital role in equilibrium analysis because it represents all points where **output (Y)** is equal to **aggregate expenditure (AE)**. This is the equilibrium condition where total spending in the economy equals total production. 
- **Above the line**: If AE is greater than output, there is excess demand, and firms will increase production.
- **Below the line**: If AE is less than output, there is excess supply, and firms will reduce production.

While trade deficits and surpluses can affect the components of aggregate expenditure, they do not alter the fundamental relationship depicted by the 45-degree line in the IS-MP model. The line remains valid as it illustrates the equilibrium condition where aggregate output equals aggregate expenditure, regardless of the specific composition of spending, including net exports.

### 4) **Factors Causing Changes in the AE Curve**
<br>

Several factors can cause shifts or changes in the slope of the AE curve:

- **Consumer Confidence**: When consumers are optimistic about the future, they tend to spend more, which shifts the AE curve upward.
  
- **Government Spending**: Fiscal policy changes directly affect the government’s component of aggregate expenditure. Increased spending shifts AE upwards, while cuts shift it downwards.

- **Interest Rates**: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, encouraging more investment and shifting the AE curve upward.

- **Net Exports**: Changes in global demand for a country's goods and services (or shifts in the exchange rate) can cause net exports to rise or fall, thus shifting the AE curve.

- **Wealth Effects**: Increases in household wealth, such as rising stock market values, can lead to higher consumption and shift the AE curve upwards.

### 5) **The IS Curve and Goods Market Equilibrium**
<br>

$\textbf{The IS Curve}$ in the IS-MP model shows the combination of real interest rates ($r$) and output ($Y$) that lead to equilibrium in the goods market. The IS curve is derived from the relationship:

$$
Y = C(Y - T) + I(r) + G
$$

- **Why does it slope downwards?**  
  The IS curve slopes downward because as the real interest rate $r$ rises, investment $I$ decreases, which in turn reduces output $Y$. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumption, which lowers total output.

- **Equilibrium Condition**: For every point on the IS curve, aggregate demand equals aggregate output. Any point off the IS curve represents disequilibrium, where output doesn’t match demand.

1) $\textbf{The Consumption Function}$ determines household spending as a function of income and taxes, forming part of Aggregate Expenditure.

$$
C = C_0 + c(Y - T)
$$

Where:
- $C_0$ : **Autonomous Consumption**
- $c$ : **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)** <br> For $c = 0.8$, households will spend 80 cents for every extra dollar of income.
- $Y$ : **Output or Income** <br> This is the total income that households earn in the economy, often equated with GDP.
- $T$ : **Lump-Sum Taxes** <br> A fixed amount of tax regardless of the income level.
<br><br>

2) $\textbf{The Investment Function}$ is another key component of Aggregate Expenditure. The investment function shows how much firms plan to invest at different interest rates.

$$
I = I_0 - br
$$

Where:
- $I_0$ : **Autonomous investment**
- $b$ : This is a **sensitivity parameter** that shows how much investment decreases when the interest rate $r$ rises. A higher $b$ means that firms are more sensitive to interest rates.
- $r$ : **The Real Interest Rate**
<br><br>

3) $\textbf{The Multiplier}$ measures how much total output (or income) changes in response to a change in autonomous spending. It shows the amplified effect that changes in one part of aggregate expenditure (like government spending or investment) have on total output $Y$. <br>
If the government increases spending by a certain amount, that spending becomes someone’s income. They will spend a portion of it (determined by the MPC), which then becomes someone else’s income, and so on. This "multiplies" the initial increase in spending across the economy, leading to a larger increase in total output $Y$.

- With **Lump-Sum Tax**; $$ \text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - c} $$ Where $c$ is the **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**


- With **Proportional Tax**; $$ \text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - c(1 - t)} $$ Where $t$ is the **Tax Rate**.

**Example**: Under a lump-sum tax regime, if the MPC ($c$) is 0.8, then the multiplier is:
$$
\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5
$$
meaning that a $1 increase in government spending will result in a $5 increase in total output.

Under a proportional tax regime with a rate of 10% ($t = 0.1$). The new multiplier is:
$$
\frac{1}{1 - 0.8(1 - 0.1)} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.8 \times 0.9} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.72} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57
$$
So, with the proportional tax, a $1 increase in government spending now leads to a $3.57 increase in total output (instead of $5 as in the lump-sum case).
